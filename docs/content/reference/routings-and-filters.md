# Routing & Filters

A routing defines a set of rules for routing traffic between different services within the same cluster.
Vamp allows you to determine this in two ways:

1. by setting a **weight** in the percentage of traffic.
2. by setting a **filter** condition to target specific traffic.

You can define routings inline in a blueprint or store them separately under a unique name and just use that name to reference them from a blueprint. Just `POST` them to the `/routings` endpoint. For instance:

```yaml
---
name: red   # Custom name, can be referenced later on.
            # Amount of traffic for this service in percents.
weight: 10
            # Custom filters.
filters:    # Anonymous with condition.
  - condition: user-agent != ios
            # As a reference, shortened of "name: my_filter_1"
  - my_filter_1
```

*Notice* we referenced a filter named `my_filter_1` here. This filter is actually a reference to a separately stored filter definition we stored under a unique name on the `/filters` endpoint.

## Defining weights

When defining weights, please make sure the total weight always adds up to 100%. This means that when doing a straight three-way split you give one service 34% as `33+33+34=100`. Vamp has to account for all traffic and 1% can be a lot in high volume environments.

## Defining filters
Creating filters is quite eas y. Checking Headers, Cookies, Hosts etc. is all possible. Under the hood, Vamp uses [Haproxy's ACL's](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#7.1) and you can use the exact ACL definition right in the blueprint in the `condition` field of a filter.

However, ACL's can be somewhat opaque and cryptic. That's why Vamp has a set of convenient "short codes"
to address common use cases. Currently, we support the following:

```
User-Agent = *string*
Host = *string*
Cookie *cookie name* Contains *string*
Has Cookie *cookie name*
Misses Cookie *cookie name*
Header *header name* Contains *string*
Has Header *header name*
Misses Header *header name*
```
Vamp is also quite flexible when it comes to the exact syntax. This means the following are all equivalent:

```
hdr_sub(user-agent) Android   # straight ACL
user-agent=Android            # lower case, no white space
User-Agent=Android            # upper case, no white space
user-agent = Android          # lower case, white space
```

Having multiple conditions in a filter is perfectly possible. In this case all filters are implicitly
"OR"-ed together, as in "if the first filter doesn't match, proceed to the next". For example, the following filter would first check whether the string "Chrome" exists in the User-Agent header of a
request. If that doesn't result in a match, it would check whether the request has the header 
"X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER". So any request matching either condition would go to this service.

```yaml
---
routing:
  weight: 0
  filters:
    - condition: User-Agent = Chrome
    - condition: Has Header X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER
```

Using a tool like [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) makes testing this a breeze.

    http GET http://10.26.184.254:9050/ X-VAMP-MY-COOL-HEADER:stuff

**Notice** we set the weight to 0 in the above example. This means per default no traffic is send to a service that has this routing. *Only* when one of the filter conditions is met any traffic will flow to this service.
